# BackPropagation
I have implemented a class for a single-hidden-layer backpropagation neural network (multilayer perceptron) using numpy. I have also tested it for multiclass classification using datasets from sklearn, and the results are quite good.

"BackPropagation.py" is a complete solution for a three-class classification problem using the "load.iris()" dataset. I have adjusted all the model parameters and used cross-validation to select the best neural network.

Please download "BackPropagation.py" to run it, along with the sklearn library because the dataset is from there. I have also used one-hot encoding for data preprocessing.

"BpClass.py" is a separate file where I have encapsulated the class for the single-hidden-layer neural network. You can import it for use.
